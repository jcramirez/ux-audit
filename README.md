# Introduction

## Goals
This UX Audit will evaluate the platform from various heuristic perspectives and provide analysis regarding the severity, scope and possible solutions that can be explored for each specific problem surfaced. The focus tends to be on actionable UX issues but in the case of kyu, we also point out opportunities for design work as we see them.

## Methodology 

The design crew reviewed existing designs and functionalities currently on the platform. After doing a clickthrough of the product and identifying where areas of ux friction occurs, research, discussion and consolidation of findings with the team are distilled into this document.

## Baseline

The product scope that this UX Audit covers are:
- End-to-end experience in the **platform** 
- End to end experience in the **profile builder**

## Executive Sumary 

A total of **20** issues have been identified and explored in this UX Audit. The **5** highest priority issues all gravitate around navigation, error prevention and recovery, user control and  consistency. For this product, we are cognizant that the work is in progress and iterative. Much of the issues we found were more opportunities for tweaks not catastrophic. This is in part because the product is quite new, so users can’t yet get themselves into dire situations in the application.

#### Positive we saw
We went through the whole experience and also found several positives along the way:
- Overall **typographic balance and visual continuity **
  - The overall visual feel was cohesive and felt very professional
  - The eyeball knows where to focus
- **UX copy** 
  - Most of the copy in the application feels quite clear 
- **Summary sentences **
  - Mechanism is very useful and extendable as use cases grow 
- The **profile builder** feels quite human
  - The ‘human touch’ is definitely present in the profile builder, it was generally nice to use
- General coolness
  - The platform
